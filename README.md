# Entry-Tech-Test

This is a sample entry tech test that I completed as a part of my internship, where I demonstrated my ability to familiarize myself with JavaScript and React during the course of 1 week, out of my own initiative.

For the test, I was given a screenshot of an instagram-like follower UI, where I was asked to create a list of accounts with a "follow" button. On clicking the button, it should change appearance & the account should be removed from the list.

This was a challenge as I had no JavaScript or React experience, but I succeeded in self-educating myself to complete this tech test.
